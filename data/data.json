    "Info": "Absolutely amazing gig, words can't describe but I'll try.\nHe played the Kilty Stone which is my favourite song of all time.\nThere was a considerate break half way through to get drinks (& a smoke :|), don't think that happens much.\nHe got more drunk as the night went on but the playing didn't suffer.\nA great mix of old and new songs with great banter with the audience.\nThe string replacement happened again which never gets old.\nOne thing I love about Live gigs is that fact that not everything is perfect, words were forgotten, notes were missed but if you want it exactly the same just listen to the album.\nI think he needs to release more Live albums as this is where he shines, so many songs aren't done justice on the studio releases ...",
