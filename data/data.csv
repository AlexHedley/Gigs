1,Francis Dunnery,Tyne Journal Theatre,Newcastle,2010-10-25 00:00:00 +0000,"First Time I'd heard anything other than Good Life (from Scrubs) Absolutely amazing, it flew by, could have listened to it all night",2010-11-01 00:00:00 +0000
2,David Ford,The Sage,Gateshead,2008-01-29 00:00:00 +0000,"Absolutely Brilliant. It was in Hall 2 which is perfect for a musician like David, felt more like you were in a private gig.",2010-11-02 00:00:00 +0000

4,Nick Harper,Cluny,Newcastle,2010-11-20 00:00:00 +0000,"Absolutely amazing gig, words can't describe but I'll try.
He played the Kilty Stone which is my favourite song of all time.
There was a considerate break half way through to get drinks (& a smoke :|), don't think that happens much.
He got more drunk as the night went on but the playing didn't suffer.
A great mix of old and new songs with great banter with the audience.
The string replacement happened again which never gets old.
One thing I love about Live gigs is that fact that not everything is perfect, words were forgotten, notes were missed but if you want it exactly the same just listen to the album.
I think he needs to release more Live albums as this is where he shines, so many songs aren't done justice on the studio releases ...",2010-11-21 13:45:05 +0000
